# DEEP-Learning-in-Python-Book-Francois-Chollet-

Deep learning is a specific subfield of machine learning, a new take on learning
representations from data which puts an emphasis on learning successive "layers" of
increasingly meaningful representations. The "deep" in "deep learning" is not a reference
to any kind of "deeper" understanding achieved by the approach, rather, it simply stands
for this idea of successive layers of representations—how many layers contribute to a
model of the data is called the "depth" of the model. Other appropriate names for the field
could have been "layered representations learning" or "hierarchical representations
learning". Modern deep learning often involves tens or even hundreds of successive
layers of representation—and they are all learned automatically from exposure to training
data. Meanwhile, other approaches to machine learning tend to focus on learning only
one or two layers of representation of the data. Hence they are sometimes called "shallow
learning".
